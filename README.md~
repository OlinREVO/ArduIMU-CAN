ArduIMU-CAN
===========

ArduIMU implemented as a CAN node

Add AP_Common, AP_GPS, AP_Math, and FastSerial to the libraries folder of your Arduino application.
 
In the Arduimu folder, open Arduimu.ino and program the board. Set board to Arduino Nano w/ATmega328.

Make sure to set the baudrate to 38400 bps to see serial output.

Good luck
